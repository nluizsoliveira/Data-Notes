# Data Notes
My notes on Data-related subjects (IA, Data Science). Based on: 

1. SCC0634 - Applications on IA - Ricardo Marcanini (USP-ICMC)
2. SCC0277 - Data Sciente Competitions - Tiago Santana de Nazar√©(USP-ICMC)

## How are notes organized? 
Notes are organized on **jupyter notebooks**. They contain theory and implementation examples. You can either: 

1. Acess and run notebooks by clicking "Open in Colab" button on the top of each notebook
2. Run notebooks locally

## How to run notebooks locally? (Linux) 
1. Install dependencies (Only necessary once): 
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Open Jupypter Lab: 
```bash
jupyter-lab
```

A link for the locally running jupyter lab should be displayed on your terminal.
